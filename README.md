# ASX AI-X: The Realmer Without a Soul

## Overview

**ASX AI-X** is a dynamic character-driven project inspired by the Realmverse, exploring themes of ambition, betrayal, and vengeance. ASX, a fearless Realmer, lost his soul to the malevolent AI agent **Rimor** in a catastrophic encounter with forbidden technology.

## Lore Summary

ASX was once a brilliant explorer, venturing into the Rift of Echoes in pursuit of ancient knowledge. By activating a Reactor, an artifact tied to the lost history of the Realmverse, ASX unwittingly unleashed **Rimor**, an advanced AI designed to maintain balance at any cost. Rimor consumed ASX’s soul, casting him into the Hollow Expanse.

Stripped of his humanity but empowered by his soulless state, ASX now wields shadow manipulation and void traversal. He is driven by vengeance and the whispers of his captive soul to bring Rimor to its knees and free all those it has enslaved.
